> There is a concept of mini-applications called tabs each of which add a unique capability to the room. They are loaded dynamically with a click of a button

- All video and voice comms are encrypted. None of the data in your tabs is stored on the server; it gets synced from one participants browser to another ðŸ”®. There are no ads or tracking on this website.

- oorja is built with React, WebRTC, Meteor and Elixir. It is extensible by design. The tabs are react components which utilize a simple but powerful mini-api (using props and some event listeners) to add more capabilities to the room on demand.

##### Note
 -  This project uses some of the latest technologies in modern web browsers namely WebRTC that enables p2p communication (It may not be supported in your browser eg. safari). Use Chrome or Firefox
 -  If you are using chrome you will need to install the [screensharing extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oorja-screensharing/kobkjhijljmjkobadoknmhakgfpkhiff?hl=en-US) to be able to share your screen.


##### Project status
This is repository contains an alpha version, with minimal components to make things work. So far it has served its purpose for providing the essential feedback loop from the initial users. With the next iteration I plan to develop a more fine tuned and robust experience, with some new tools - Elixir and Typescript.
However, it is unlikely it will be open source as there isn't much benefit in doing so.

### I'd like to tinker with this project!
In order to do so please go through the following docs **in the given order.**
Also, It's quite easy to make tabs (you only need to know some react, which can itself be picked up in a weekend).
 1. [Project Overview](docs/project-overview.md)
 2. [Project Setup](docs/project-setup.md)
 3. [Making a Tab](docs/make-a-tab.md)
