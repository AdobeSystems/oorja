#### There is a concept of mini-applications called tabs each of which add a unique capability to the room. They are loaded dynamically with a click of a button

> All video and voice comms are encrypted. None of the data in your tabs is stored on the server; it gets synced from one participants browser to another ðŸ”®. There are no ads or tracking on this website.

#### oorja is built with React, WebRTC, Meteor and Elixir. It is extensible by design. The tabs are react components which utilize a simple but powerful mini-api (using props and some event listeners) to add more capabilities to the room on demand.

##### Note
 -  This project uses some of the latest technologies in modern web browsers namely WebRTC that enables p2p communication (It may not be supported in your browser eg. safari). Use Chrome or Firefox
 -  If you are using chrome you will need to install the [screensharing extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oorja-screensharing/kobkjhijljmjkobadoknmhakgfpkhiff?hl=en-US) to be able to share your screen.

### Donate
